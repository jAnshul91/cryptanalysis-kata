friday and saturday passed uneventfully  tuppence had received a brief answer to her appeal from mr  carter  in it he pointed out that the young adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk  and had been fully warned of the dangers  if anything had happened to tommy he regretted it deeply  but he could do nothing  this was cold comfort  somehow  without tommy  all the savour went out of the adventure  and  for the first time  tuppence felt doubtful of success  while they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute  although she was accustomed to take the lead  and to pride herself on her quick wittedness  in reality she had relied upon tommy more than she realized at the time  there was something so eminently sober and clear headed about him  his common sense and soundness of vision were so unvarying  that without him tuppence felt much like a rudderless ship  it was curious that julius  who was undoubtedly much cleverer than tommy  did not give her the same feeling of support  she had accused tommy of being a pessimist  and it is certain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was optimistically given to overlooking  but nevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment  he might be slow  but he was very sure  it seemed to the girl that  for the first time  she realized the sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly  it had begun like a page of romance  now  shorn of its glamour  it seemed to be turning to grim reality  tommy  that was all that mattered  many times in the day tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely   little fool   she would apostrophize herself   don t snivel  of course you re fond of him  you ve known him all your life  but there s no need to be sentimental about it   in the meantime  nothing more was seen of boris  he did not come to the flat  and julius and the car waited in vain  tuppence gave herself over to new meditations  whilst admitting the truth of julius s objections  she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to sir james peel edgerton  indeed  she had gone so far as to look up his address in the  red book   had he meant to warn her that day  if so  why  surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation  he had looked at her so kindly  perhaps he might tell them something concerning mrs  vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to tommy s whereabouts  anyway  tuppence decided  with her usual shake of the shoulders  it was worth trying  and try it she would  sunday was her afternoon out  she would meet julius  persuade him to her point of view  and they would beard the lion in his den  when the day arrived julius needed a considerable amount of persuading  but tuppence held firm   it can do no harm   was what she always came back to  in the end julius gave in  and they proceeded in the car to carlton house terrace  the door was opened by an irreproachable butler  tuppence felt a little nervous  after all  perhaps it  was  colossal cheek on her part  she had decided not to ask if sir james was  at home   but to adopt a more personal attitude
